<p>
Two seconds after the page finishes loading,
http://www.willmaster.com/test.zip will begin downloading.
(This is done with the <meta...> tag in the head
area. See notes in the source code about changing URL
and timing.)
</p>
<p>
Nine seconds after the page finishes loading, the page
will redirect to http://www.willmaster.com/ ï¿½ the
download may or may not be finished by the time the page
is redirected. (This is done with the JavaScript located
below this point in the source code, although it could
be located pretty much anywhere. See notes in the source
code about changing URL and timing.)
</p>


<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript"><!--

function Redirect() {
// The URL between the quotation marks may be changed.
window.location = "http://www.willmaster.com/";
}

// The timing may be changed by changing the number in the
//   setTimeout function call parameters. The number represents
//   thousandths of a second. Therefore, 9000 is 9 seconds.
window.onload = function() { setTimeout("Redirect()",9000); }
